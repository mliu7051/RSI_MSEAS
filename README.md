# RSI_MSEAS
Compiling all the code from my 2022 RSI project at the MSEAS lab.

ANN is the python file containing all of the code for creating the neural network + performing hyperparameter optimization on it.
BH is an excel file of incomplete water buoy data from Boston Harbor.
charles.csv is a subset of the water buoy data from the Charles river (data cleansing was not completed on this file).
sample.csv was a small subset of the data from Boston Harbor.

Here are links to other sources of water quality data I found but didn't end up using for my project:
